    <p>
      My name is Terrell. I work as a Sr. Software Engineer, for a large
      financial services firm, in the Greater Philadelphia area. Most recently,
      I've spent lot of time deploying Python based solutions in AWS to help investment
      professionals: realize alpha, reduce risk, or improve productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a tooling standpoint, I'm often jumping across the python data
      science ecosystem, regularly relying on Anaconda, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy,
      and sometimes Machine Learning libraries like Tensorflow. In AWS, I've
      worked with numerous core services such as (ECS, SageMaker, S3, Step
      Functions, Lambda, etc).

      I've uniquely spent time in a wide variety of functions and held a handful
      of different roles including: Financial / Data Analyst, Product Owner,
      Software Engineer. This has given me a unique perspective on
      what it takes to deliver effective data driven solutions.
