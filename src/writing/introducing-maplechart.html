<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://maplechart.com/docs/intro">MapleChart.com</a> is a free, publicly accesible REST api,
    used for fetching historical timeseries indicators
    and market data across numerous cryptocurrency pairs. I created MapleChart to save you time.
    When I first started analyzing historical crypto metrics, I was severely limited by the amount
    of time I had to spend fetching, updating, cleaning, calculating, and storing data. With
    MapleChart, you can fetch pre-calculated metrics in a few api calls, and focus on your analysis. If
    you must, feel free to skip this blog post and checkout MapleChart's
    <a href="https://maplechart.com/docs/intro">awesome documentation</a> for more info.
</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fetch core market data like price, market-cap, 24hr global volume</li>
    <li>Fetch timeseries indicators such as: simple moving average and trailing return</li>
    <li>Free to use</li>
    <li>No api key required</li>
    <li>Easy to use documentation</li>
    <li>Updated daily ~1hr after market close (01:00 UTC)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li>~10 of the largest crypto currencies vs USD & vs BTC (~20 pairs in total)</li>
    <li>2 indicators and 12 signals</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple Moving Average (20, 50, 100, 200 day)</li>
        <li>Trailing Return (1D, 7D, 30D, 90D, YTD, 1YR, 3YR 5YR)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
    To start, only a core set of assets and
    indicators are available. As time permits, I'll consider significantly increasing the available
    indicators, and trading pairs.
</p>

<h2>A Python Example </h2>
<p>
    Below is a simple python snippet showcasing how to fetch the entire 200 day simple moving average
    history for the ETH/USD trading pair.
</p>
<pre><code>import json
import requests  # pip install requests

url = "https://api.maplechart.com/v1/signals/sma-200d/history?pair=eth-usd"
r = requests.get(url)
data = r.json()["data"]

print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))</code></pre>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
    As mentioned above, I built MapleChart to save you time. However I also built it for a few other
    reasons. First, I believe alot of people don't fully appreciate how wild cryptocurrency markets are.
    With a little information, people would be better prepared to handle the rollercoaster. Making data
    available is the first step in an effort to help people make more informed decisions.
</p>

<p>
    Are you really prepared to buy something that could lose 80% of its value, multiple times over? Is
    someone trying to sell you a dream that sounds too good to be true? The mere existence of MapleChart
    won't eradicate bad decisions completely but if it helps at least one person, it was worth building.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, I built MapleChart because I was looking for a great sideproject idea that
    would force me to explore a few new AWS Services. I figured a serverless data pipeline and rest api
    would be perfect. Maybe oneday I'll write another post about my learning process.
